Installation instructions for C Compiler (Windows) 
**************************************************
1) Download and install SDK7.1 (or later) for Windows.
2) In case SDK7.1 fails to install, from Control Panel, remove C++ redistributable 2010 (both x86 and x64). 
   SDK7.1 will reinstall them during the process.
3) Run command 'mex -setup' in MATLAB’s Command Window.
4) Select the compiler corresponding to  the Microsoft Software Development Kit (SDK) installed in (1)


Runtime instructions
********************
1) Download and install EPANET 2.0. 
2) Use EPANET 2.0 GUI to create the network using LPS flow units, and save it (i.e. extension .NET).
3) From File-> Export -> Network, export the saved .NET file in .inp format, in program's main folder.
4) In file "UPStream_configure_and_execute.m", set: 
   i) The name of the pipe network input (.inp) file from (3). 
   ii) The minimum pressure (pmin) constraint for the network nodes (e.g. pmin = 0 for zero minimum pressure at all
       network nodes, pmin = 12 for 12m of nimimum pressure).
   iii) The maximum permissible number of successive itterations at a node of the network (If exceeded,the network 
        is flagged as unsolvable, the program stops, and a message is printed on screen and at the end of the UPStream 
        report file. The user should properly modify the network, or change the pmin constraint, and try again).
   iv) Save the script.
5) In case needed, modify the velocity constrains by opening "vmax_constraints_function.m" and customizing it 
   according to needs; then save.
6) In case needed, modify the way diameters are selected by opening "change_diameter_function.m" and customizing 
   it according to needs; then save. 
5) Execute "UPStream_configure_and_execute.m" from Matlab's Command Window. Two .txt report files, a network binary file (.bin),
   a .mat file with MatLab's workspace, and a new network .inp file with the updated diameters,will be placed in a newly 
   generated folder named after the original input file. Note that the original .inp file in the program's main folder remains unchanged. 
   The user may import the newly generated .inp file to EPANET for further processsing.
